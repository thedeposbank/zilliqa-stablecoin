| Name | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
|`name`         | `String`  | A human readable token name. |
|`symbol`       | `String`  | A ticker symbol for the token. |
|`decimals`     | `Uint32`  | Defines the smallest unit of the tokens|
|`init_owner`   | `ByStr20` | The initial owner of the contract. |

### Mutable fields

The table below presents the mutable fields of the contract and their initial values.

#### Simple fields
| Name | Type | Initial Value |Description |
|--|--|--|--|
|`owner`        | `ByStr20` | `init_owner`  | Current `owner` in the contract. |

|`balances`             | `Map ByStr20 Uint128` | Empty | Keeps track of the number of tokens that each token holder owns. |
|`allowed`              | `Map ByStr20 (Map ByStr20 Uint128)` | Empty | Keeps track of the `approvedSpender` for each token holder and the number of tokens that she is allowed to spend on behalf of the token holder. |
| `approvedContracts` | `Map ByStr20 Uint128` | Empty | Each key in this map represetns approved address no matter what value it is mapped to. |

#### Pause-related Transitions

| Name | Params | Description | Callable when paused? |
|--|--|--|--|
|`pause`|  | Pause the contract to temporarily stop all transfer of tokens and other operations. Only the current `pauser` can invoke this transition.  <br>  :warning: **Note:** `_sender` must be the current `pauser` in the contract.  | :heavy_check_mark: |

#### Token Transitions

| Name | Params | Description | Callable when paused? |
|--|--|--|--|
|`BalanceOf`| `tokenOwner : ByStr20` | Transition to learn balance of some token owner. Sends back message `BalanceOfResponse` with fields `address` and `balance`. | :heavy_check_mark: |
|`Approve`| `spender : ByStr20, value : Uint128` | Approve a `spender` to spend on behalf of a token holder (`_sender`) upto the `value` amount. <br> `spender` and `_sender` must not be blacklisted. | :x:  |
|`Transfer`| `to : ByStr20, value : Uint128, code : Uint32` | Transfer `value` number of tokens from the `_sender` to the `to` address.  <br>  `_sender` and `to` addresses must not be blacklisted.| :x: |
|`TransferFrom`| `from : ByStr20, to : ByStr20, value : Uint128, code : Uint32` | Transfer `value` number of tokens on behalf of the `from` to the `to` address.  <br>  `_sender`, `from`, `to` addresses must not be blacklisted.| :x:  |

#### Minting-related Transitions
